# Conversations about teaching computational skills to undergraduates

If you have ideas or would like to contribute to the discussion, please do so in [the issues
tracker](https://github.com/carpentries/undergrad-education-conversations/issues). Below are the key topics
 raised to date and the general state of each discussion.

## [Integrating computation across curricula](https://github.com/carpentries/undergrad-education-conversations/issues/7)
* Could continuous exposure to computation and data manipulation throughout a bachelor program, coupled with compelling
 topic specific problems, be more effective than dedicated bioinformatics/statistics courses?
  * Pull material out of a vacuum and into real(ish) world context.
  * Empower students to begin using more sophisticated tools by guiding them through the initial learning curves.
* Implementation may involve first year core course (e.g., semester-long Data Carpentryesk course, perhaps called
 'Data Literacy Skills for Biological Sciences'), followed by computation modules incorporated into later course labs.
* 'Competency' is very hard without significant time investment.
* We need curricula road maps; identify the short, medium, and long term learning objectives, and
make a plan to get there.
* Can't assume current faculty will be able to do this on their own, so training TA's or having
dedicated personnel may be important

## Further topics that have been suggested, but not yet fleshed out
* Is there some cost associated with teaching undergrads the traditionally memory
intensive biology content at the same time as the more logic focused computational content?
* How do we deal with coding fear?
  * The very first skill students require is to not be terrified
  * Semester long SWC/DC-esk course(s) very early
* Domain-specific skills will be important and even 'bioinformatics' is broad, so what commonalities can be extracted
 to give students the best framework for branching into more specialized topics later?
  * Basic coding skills
  * Basic shell tools
  * Focus on what to do with tabular data, statistics, modelling, noisy matrices
  * Teach students to troubleshoot and to learn from manuals/forums/peers/etc
  * Do's and don'ts for basic script design (antipatterns)

## History
This repostitory has been created as an extension of a 'Birds of a Feather' discussion at the 2017 iEvoBio conference,
 where ideas where bandied about for building new undergraduate bioinformatics curricula and teaching undergraduates
 (in any field) computing generally. We wanted a centralized place to put those ideas, but also wanted to make sure
 they were accessible to the broader community. Thank you GitHub :)
